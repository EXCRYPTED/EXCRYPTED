I've been asked multiple times to what my most used **Name Tags** or **Abbreviations** mean, so here's a small list explaining each one in detail.

```
𝗪𝟮𝗖 <- Whisper To Contact

𝗜𝗪𝗖 <- Interact With Caution

𝗗𝗡𝗜 <- Do Not Interact
 
𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗙 + 𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗣 <- Do Not Interact Unless Friend + Partner 〈 𝗦𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗣 𝗮𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿 〉

𝗦𝗩 + 𝗡𝗩 <- Non Verbal 〈 𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 〉

𝗞𝗡 + 𝗞𝗜𝗡 <- Kinning 〈 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 〉

𝗔𝗙𝗗 <- Away From Device
```
