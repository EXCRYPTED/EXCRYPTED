〈 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝗿. 〉

My name is **Veil**, but you can also refer to me as **X**

#
More information will be shown in the upcoming Carrd that would be linked to your left. Since it's still currently in development, patience would be very appreciated until further notice. Thank you.

# 
I've been asked multiple times to what my most used **Name Tags** or **Abbreviations** mean, so here's a small list explaining each one in detail.

```
𝗪𝟮𝗖 <- Whisper To Contact

𝗜𝗪𝗖 <- Interact With Caution

𝗗𝗡𝗜 <- Do Not Interact
 
𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗙 + 𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗣 <- Do Not Interact Unless Friend + Partner 〈 𝗦𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗗𝗡𝗜𝗨𝗣 𝗮𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝘆 𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿 〉

𝗦𝗩 + 𝗡𝗩 <- Non Verbal 〈 𝗦𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 〉

𝗞𝗡 + 𝗞𝗶𝗻 <- Kinning 〈 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 〉

𝗔𝗙𝗗 <- Away From Device
```
